# Stringly

Stringly is an Elixir package packed with a wide range of string manipulation functions. Taking inspiration from Laravel's `Illuminate\Support\Str` helper, it boosts Elixir's native `String` module with some extra handy tools.

## Installation

You can find Stringly on Hex. Add `stringly` to your dependencies in `mix.exs` to get started:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:stringly, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Check out the [documentation on Hexdocs](https://hexdocs.pm/stringly) for more details on how to use it.
